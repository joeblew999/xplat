# xplat Package Registry Index
#
# This index maps package names to their source repositories.
# Each repository must have an xplat.yaml at the root that describes
# the package (binary, process config, taskfile, etc.).
#
# Usage:
#   xplat pkg install <name>           # Install by name from this index
#   xplat pkg install github.com/...   # Install directly from repo URL
#
# To add a package:
#   1. Add an entry below mapping name -> repo
#   2. Ensure the repo has an xplat.yaml at root

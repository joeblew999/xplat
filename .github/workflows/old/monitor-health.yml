# Health Check Workflow
#
# Runs health checks on a schedule to verify external dependencies.
# Creates a GitHub Issue on failure for visibility/notification.
#
# Pattern: Each taskfile include has check:health tasks that verify
# external systems (git remotes, APIs, etc.) are reachable.
#
# NOTIFICATIONS:
# - GitHub Issue created with label 'health-check' on failure
# - Repo watchers get notified via GitHub notification settings
# - Configure: Settings → Notifications → Watching
#
# TEST FAILURE:
# - Manual trigger with test_failure=true to test notification flow
# - Or run locally: task ci:health:test-fail
